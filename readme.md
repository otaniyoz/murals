# A living collection of murals
Murals nicely capture feelings of a community they are created in. Often they are not treated with care, obscured, damaged, or destroyed. This is an attempt to capture murals for educational purposes while they are visible and accessible

## To contribute
You can either fill-in missing info on old murals or send a new mural; any way, you need to open an issue in this repository. If you decide to submit your photograph of a mural, please use common sense and respect the rules of Github
